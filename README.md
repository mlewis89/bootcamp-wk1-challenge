# Bootcamp Challenge Week one - Accessabilty

## Description

Purpose: to test my knowledge of semantic html elements and accessisbilty standards.

In this project i was was given the starter code of a marketing company and needed to refractor the code to ensure it it meets accessibility standards including sematic html elements, applying a logical structure to the html, ensuring all images ahave a alt text configured, heading ellements fall sequencially and the titlte is descriptive

The supplied website had no semantic html elements and was complived solely of <div> elements. there was also a missing ID that was preventing the navigation menu from functioning properly.

During the project I learnt the importance of semantic html elements and and improving code while leaving the original site the same, 


# User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
